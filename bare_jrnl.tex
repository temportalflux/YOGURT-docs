\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{op-tical net-works semi-conduc-tor}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,

\begin{abstract}
Over the course of my fall semester in my last year of undergraduate studies, I researched the field of Games User Research. It is also during this time that I conceptualized, proposed, built, tested, and iterated upon a tool to aid developers in the process of collecting analytical data representing the player experience. This tool then also processed said data, and visually represented it in a game engine so that it was easily digestible by developers. My main inspiration for this journey was helping teams in capstone better understand what their testers do in the world the developers have created, and how can we use that understand to better the player experience. The process of making and iterating on the tool took the semester, and I learned about the impact programmers have on the GUR field.

\IEEEPARstart{Y}{our} Own Games User Research Toolset (YOGURT) is a tool developed by an engineer for the purpose of collecting player experience data, processing it, and visualizing said data in engine. Over the course of September-December 2018, I developed a tool for the field of Games User Research to help game developers understand the experiences their players have in their game. This article will touch on the research I did to better understand the Games User Research field. It will also go through my journey of creating a tool in Unreal Engine 4, and the things I learned along the way. The most important thing to take away from this journey though, is how programmers can support developers in the effort to better understand the player experience. Why should programmers be involved in this process?

\section{Background/Related Works}

The field of Games User Research (otherwise known as GUR) isn’t exactly a new field in game development. In fact, its been around a while. GUR is the practice of analyzing user experience (UX) for the purpose of improving that same experience. That said, it has only been formally recognized as a discipline within the games industry in the last decade \cite{mirza-ch2}. For some studios, user experience research may tend to fall under the umbrella category of quality assurance (QA) testing, as it’s more convenient to test the game for bugs and experience all at once. There is a clear distinction in intent when it comes to QA vs GUR testing. Per definition, Quality Assurance testing is meant to test the quality of a game - to find bugs so that these bugs can be fixed so that the game is more stable. The purpose of Games User Research testing, however, is to collecting, analyzing, and act upon on data pertaining to the user’s experience of a game for the purpose of improving said experience. In short, QA is the practice of making a game bug free, whereas GUR must assume a game is stable and looks at how to give players the most enjoyable experience.
Games User Research can come in many forms. There are some companies like Player Research who have departments solely dedicated to GUR testing and analysis, and have even looked at best ways to set up a GUR lab \cite{mirza-ch6}. Many studios use surveys as one way to gather knowledge on the player experience \cite{mirza-ch9}. Surveys are by far the easiest to set up, but have pitfalls due to the reliance on player memory and transparency. There many are other ways to observe the player experience; recording video of players as they play the game, keeping track of player comments, the Think Aloud protocol, using other inputs like the Hopson Boxes, or utilizing biometrics. \cite{mirza-ch11} \cite{mirza-ch12} \cite{mirza-ch16} All that said thought, one of the most useful forms of data collection involves analytics/telemetry, and requires minimal or no effort on the part of the player. \cite{mirza-ch19} Analytics provide a concrete way for developers to see what players are doing in their game, or what is happening to them, so that as developers, they can make more informed decisions. At its core, this means gathering data, analysis, visualization, reporting, and taking action. \cite{mirza-ch19}
Individual companies and engine developers alike have already started integrating analytics into their games and platforms. Unity presented a talk during Unite 2015 which showed off their 3-dimensional heatmapping in engine \cite{unite2015}, not to mention Unity has a whole section of their pipeline dedicated to tracking game analytics. There are individual developers out there who have made analytical tools before, such as Prometheus (a 2D heatmapping tool) \cite{gibbs}. There are also a number of companies which provide game developers with ways to track analytics outside of specific engines. \cite{simpleusability} \cite{drachen} The field of Telemetry/Analytics and Biometrics is not without its case studies and research. A case study by A.Drachen looked at the player experience in platformers, focusing on comparing the difficulty of tasks with the errors made in each task. \cite{wehbe} A paper on the theoretical mathematics behind how to create heatmaps by binning data with respect to the data vs the time it was recorded. \cite{kumatani} Tool suites and studies which explore the best way to interpret player emotional state, using technology such as webcams and bpm. \cite{dingli} A case study explored the best way to evaluate user interfaces using different evaluation methods. \cite{nielsen} In an article about Gameplay Approachability Principles, Heather Desurvire and Charlotte Wiberg compared GAP with usability testing and focuses on finding the best heuristics to evaluate player experience. \cite{desurvire} In a paper on gameplay flow and immersion, Lennart Nacke and Craig A. Lindley explore commonly used, yet vague terms to describe the player experience and how their definitions affect player research. \cite{nacke}

\section{Making Yogurt}

\subsection{Process}

The first couple weeks of my study I explored and learned about the field of Games User Research, mainly from the Games User Research book \cite{mirza}. I also looked for other projects which explained their process in creating GUR tools. Having never created a tool for user data collection, I had no frame of reference for how difficult the journey would be or what kinds of data is useful.
The purpose of this study is to explore the GUR discipline through the lense of a programmer. As such, after gathering a fundamental understanding of the field, my next goal was to craft a proposal for a tool which I would later develop. This tool eventually became known as Your Own Games User Research Toolset (YOGURT or Yogurt). Yogurt is a Unreal Engine 4 plugin which provides a framework for recording data during gameplay and loading it into the editor at a later point. At its inception, Yogurt was planned to have native support for heatmaps, as they are a frequently used tool for tracking anything from player movement to death rates to actions in the world to player emotional input (lookup Hopson Boxes). Yogurt was also planned to provide native support for a feature called Timelines. This feature set would allow developers to bin/chunk data according to when they occured during gameplay so that developers could view specific chunks of gameplay. It would also allow developers to “playback” data from a starting time to an ending time, seeing what players are doing in the environment over the course of gameplay.
As a programmer new to Unreal Engine plugins, getting a working framework up and running to a chunk of time out of the couple weeks I had to prototype. With lots of hard work, and a fair bit of luck, I was able to get Yogurt up and running with basic functionality. It allowed developers to specify what areas to track player position heatmapping, saved that data during the game, and enabled developers to load it into engine to see the heatmap on the world surface in the 3-dimensional space. I also got in part of Timelines, which was the binning of data according to the time span that developers wanted to view.
Yogurt was built alongside a Champlain Game Studio Capstone game called Capital Vice. This allowed me to work with the developer team to determine what kind of GUR tool would be most useful. During planning, this resulted in the plan to use a heatmap to track player position throughout gameplay. Capital Vice was a multiplayer networked game, with a playtime of approximately 15 minutes. Once Yogurt was stable enough to start recording data, I was able to gather player telemetry from each play session and use this data to not only relay reports back to the team but fine tune my tool as well. It should be noted that, at Champlain, there is no dedicated GUR lab yet. Instead, data was gathered in our QA lab, which functions as a hybrid for the purpose of finding bugs and getting player feedback on games. This meant that data gathered during testing was not always valuable, and could be tainted by bugs.
After Yogurt was stable and was able to start gathering data, I found that there were some bugs with how the system processed and rendered data. Over the course of the remaining weeks, I iterated on these bugs and changes in data flow.

\subsection{Findings}

Throughout the semester, I learned a couple valuable lessons when it comes to making GUR tools. It is valuable to note that as a programmer in our game studio, I worked on Capital Vice as a programmer in capstone. This allowed me to see both lenses as a data scientist and as a developer on the game. It also gave me access to be able to internally adjust the tool as the team needed to. One large lesson learned is to start iteration as early as you can. Getting the perspectives of the developer team and getting a proof of concept working early can make or break a tool. Actually working with a team gives you the ability to figure out what is useful for them and cater specific data modules for that. Scope and feature creep exist in this realm, just like any other software or development realm. I ended up having to push off a couple features like timeline playback due to time constraints and bugs. As a data scientist, having control of the tool to design, create, and iterate on has been extremely useful. That said, I would not have the skills to do so if I was not first and foremost a programmer in the game field. All that said, the most critical portion to creating any good tool comes down to scalability. Especially when it comes to a GUR tool, being sure that the core of what your working on is modular enough can enable rapid iteration and testing when done right, or cause weeks of delays and refactoring if done wrong. At one point or another, the development team is going to ask for something you, as a programmer or data scientist, hadn’t thought of. So as a programmer participating and innovating in the GUR field, it is incredibly valuable to have a tool which you can easily add another module to and it still work basically the same.

\subsection{Continued Work}

Looking to the future of Your Own Games User Research Toolset, there are a number of things to fine tune and add that would make the tool more useful. Unfortunately, my code base was not always super modular. There were portions of the semester in which I crunched, and it made the code behind the tool less malleable. It would be great to expose the system more so new modules and ideas are easier to implement - but that’s a given for any project. Yogurt would be a great place for other kinds of modules like static event trackers or storyboards. There is even a place for eyetracking to see how players interact with UI in games. For the timelines portion of Yogurt, the playback option for developers to see what players are doing is going to be huge. Finally, making this all easier to access in Unreal’s SlateUI system, perhaps a new editor window, would do wonders for developer ease of access - especially for small teams and studios.

% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this article, you’ve touched the surface of GUR. There are thousands of games user researchers out there, some of whom are published and have written articles or books on what GUR is and how its used. You have read through my journey into GUR, starting with my inspirations to create Yogurt, the development process and hiccups along the way, and finally the tool itself and my conclusions from development. Yogurt is just one way to approach Games User Research. It is, above all, my approach to supporting developers and data scientists in the GUR field. As programmers, it is important to remain aware of fields tangential to game development, GUR especially. We have the knowledge to be able to make great tools for other developers and data scientists alike, so let’s utilize that knowledge and make some amazing stuff.


% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
